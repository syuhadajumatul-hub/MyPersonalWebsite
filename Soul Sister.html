              <font color="white" size="3"> One person that I admire the most, and who has become my role model, is my elder sister, <b> Syuhara Solehah binti Mohd Yusoff</b>. I truly look up to her because she is such a dependable and approachable person which others can easily rely on. She naturally has that “big sister” attitude that makes people feel safe and cared for. We grew up very close since we are only a year apart, but people often mistake me as the older one because she has a petite figure and is slightly shorter than me.</font>
          </p>
         

          <p style="letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 1.3;">
              <font color="white" size="3">  When we were younger, I didn’t really like being compared to her. Many people, especially our father, often held high expectations for her because she was academically intelligent and sociable, while I was quieter and more reserved. At that time, I couldn’t see what made her so special in everyone’s eyes. However, as I grew older, I began to realize that her achievements were not simply because she was “gifted,” but because she worked extremely hard for everything. I have seen her stay up late to study, cry out of stress, and still manage to smile the next day. Despite the pressure of being seen as the “father’s child,” she never let that image break her spirit.</font> 
          </p>

          <p style="letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 1.3;">
             <font color="white" size="3">What I admire most about her is her determination and resilience. No matter what challenges she faces, she never gives up, instead, she finds solutions and treats every obstacle as an opportunity to grow. Watching her strength and dedication has inspired me to work harder and stay positive in everything I do. I truly hope that one day, I can be as strong, confident, and hardworking as my sister.</font>

          <p style="letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 1.3;">
              <font color="white" size="3">  My sister is like the sun…bright, energetic, and full of warmth. She has this natural ability to lift people’s spirits and make every moment feel lighter. Her confidence and cheerfulness are contagious, and she has a way of making everyone around her feel comfortable and included. She approaches life boldly, always ready to take on challenges, and her energy is something that inspires me every day.</font>

          <p style="letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 1.3;">
              <font color="white" size="3">  I, on the other hand, am more like the moon…calm, reflective, and quiet. I take my time to observe, think, and understand before I act. My presence is softer, offering a sense of balance and serenity to the world around me. I like to reflect, to think deeply, and to bring a calm perspective when situations get overwhelming. While she shines brightly and boldly, I provide a gentle light that complements her energy.</font>
          </p>

          <p style="letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 1.3;">
             <font color="white" size="3">Together, we create a balance that feels natural. Her energy encourages me to step out of my comfort zone, while my calmness gives her space to slow down when needed. We are different in personality yet connected in ways that make us stronger together. She brings brightness and warmth, I bring reflection of calm and in that quiet harmony, we find our bond, each adding our own kind of light to each other’s lives.</font>

                 I have a cat named Oyen,
                 which I adopted from an exhibition at Sunway Putra Mall in Kuala Lumpur.
                  There were so many adorable cats there, all hoping to find new homes through adoption.
                  We only needed to pay RM150 to cover its expenses such as vaccination, neutering, food, cat litter, and a carrier. 
                 My sister and I, who both love cats so much, couldn’t resist their cuteness.
                 It was such a coincidence that we visited the mall on the day of the exhibition because we had recently lost our previous cat.

                    The person in charge of the adoption was very kind and offered to send Oyen to my house since we went there by public transport, which doesn’t allow animals.
                    We were really thankful for her help and kindness. When Oyen first arrived at my house, he was very scared and kept hiding in unreachable spots. It took him about three days to feel comfortable with us. Now, Oyen is no longer afraid of me and my family. 
                    He has become part of our home and brings us happiness every day.

                    "An oyen cat refers to an orange-colored cat, well-known in 
                    Malaysia for its playful yet mischievous personality. Oyen cats are often described
                    as manja, adventurous, and sometimes a little dramatic, which makes them even more 
                    lovable. Their bright orange fur and expressive faces give them a unique charm that 
                    many people find adorable. Although they sometimes act stubborn or chaotic, oyen cats are 
                    usually very affectionate and enjoy human attention. Because of their funny behaviour and 
                    strong personality, oyens have become a popular meme and a beloved character in Malaysian pet culture.""
